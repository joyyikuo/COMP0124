# Team 21 - Multi-Agent AI Group Project

## Description

In display and mobile advertising, the most significant evolution in recent years is the employment of the so called Real-Tie Bidding (RTB) mechanism to buy and sell ads. RTB essentially facilitates buying an individual ad impression in real time, automatically triggered by a user's visit.
In this assignment, we were required to help advertisers to form a bidding strategy in order to place their ads online in a real-time bidding system. Further description of this project can be viewed in the [Project Description](https://github.com/joyyikuo/JYD-BACSAI-19/blob/master/assignment_description.pdf)

### Results

We conducted 5 main bidding strategies, including: constant, random, linear, non-linear, multi-agent. The results of our experiment can be viewed in the table below. Tested on the validation dataset, the linear bidding strategy received the most clicks with 162 clicks.
